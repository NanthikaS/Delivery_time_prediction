# Delivery_time_prediction
we are calulating and analysing the delivery time for the food 

Import the data from the kaggle.

calculating the distance between two points usin haversine formula

using scatter chart we showed the time taken and distance to delivery the food. The chart shows it is within 20-30 mins, regardless of distance

The second chart is to find the relationship between delivery person age and the distance. It shopws that most likely young partner delivered quickly

This file also have some other charts

from keras we imported the Dense, sequential and LSTM  for creating the model. Trained the model using the Adam Optimizer and mean-squared-error as loss.

Atlast, predicted the total distance by the user input.
